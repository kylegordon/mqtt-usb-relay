SUMMARY
=======

This script will sit and listen for MQTT messages and then act upon them to turn
USB connected relays on and off.  The topic it subscribes to is /raw/`hostname
-f`/usb-relay/#, and it takes the last component of the topic as the relay
number to control.
It was originally written as a hack to control a USB relay from Domoticz, and
whilst it could be made to understand the JSON output of the 3rd party mqtt.js
it was decided to keep things simple, and to use the On and Off Actions built
into Domoticz to trigger simple mosquitto_pub events.

The format of such an event would be script://///usr/bin/mosquitto_pub -h
mqtt.vpn.glasgownet.com -t /raw/wmlp1000.vpn.glasgownet.com/usb-relay/1 -m 1 to
turn on relay 1

INSTALL
=======

The latest Mosquitto libraries are required. 
If on Ubuntu, sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mosquitto-dev/mosquitto-ppa; apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python-mosquitto python-serial git
mkdir /etc/mqtt-usb-relay/
git clone git://github.com/kylegordon/mqtt-usb-relay.git /usr/local/mqtt-usb-relay/
cp /usr/local/mqtt-usb-relay/mqtt-usb-relay.cfg.example /etc/mqtt-usb-relay/mqtt-usb-relay.cfg
cp /usr/local/mqtt-usb-relay/mqtt-usb-relay.init /etc/init.d/mqtt-usb-relay
update-rc.d mqtt-usb-relay defaults
cp /usr/local/mqtt-usb-relay/mqtt-usb-relay.default /etc/default/mqtt-usb-relay
## Edit /etc/default/mqtt-usb-relay and /etc/mqtt-usb-relay/mqtt-usb-relay.cfg to suit
/etc/init.d/mqtt-usb-relay start

USE
===

Publish 1 or 0 to an appropriate topic, such as
/raw/wmlp1000.vpn.glasgownet.com/usb-relay/1

With Domoticz, using a dummy switch if desired, enter this into the On or Off
Action field 

script://///usr/bin/mosquitto_pub -h mqtt.vpn.glasgownet.com -t /raw/wmlp1000.vpn.glasgownet.com/usb-relay/1 -m 1
